# My Storage (In development)
A web application for storing my projects information and my blogs.

## Background
My problem started when I created my portfolio website. I thought at that time, when this website is already
published, then I want to add my new project information to the website, I have to open the source code of the website, 
then edit the file after that push.

If I do that in the long run, then the commit history will be filled with `added a new project`, `edit project`, 
`remove project`. So I'm going to have quite a bit of problem to tracking the changes of my portfolio repository. So, I 
created this application manage all my projects information and my blogs.
